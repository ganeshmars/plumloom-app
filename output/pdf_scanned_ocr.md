# To THE OWNERS OF WATER RIGHTS IN OWENS VALLEY

On Thursday, September 16th, 1905, the city of Los Angeles will vote for or against the issuance of $81,600,000 of bonds, for the purpose of acquiring water rights in Owens Valley. The service required of water will cover one acre of land over eighteen feet deep in 365 days. The land is to be covered to a depth of four feet during the irrigating season.

Counting the loss in reservoirs and ditches, one inch of water should irrigate four acres of alfalfa. Here, then, is the value of an inch of water used for raising alfalfa on land we consider takes more than the average amount of water. The average yield of alfalfa, including spring and fall pasturage, is five tons per acre. The net value clear of labor is $40.08 per ton.

Your committee believes that it is their ultimate intention to buy every inch of water in Owens Valley. We base our belief on the statements made by the City Engineer of Los Angeles.

# Scanned Documents

- Screen readers or other assistive technology are unable to convert images scanned into text.
- Scanned documents, especially poor quality scans or handwriting, can be difficult to read for everyone.
- Scanned documents should be avoided as much as possible.
- If the document can be found in the library, a reference to the library item can be provided.
- Benefits of having a digital copy:
---
# Scanned Documents - OCR

Success is highly dependent upon:

- The quality of the scan depends on the device
- The quality of the OCR engine

Some Gotchas

- Colored backgrounds
- Handwritten text
- Poor quality scan depends on the device

After improving the quality of the scan document, the next step is tagging PDF accessibility markup.
---
# Live or Real Text

- To check if the text is “live” or “real,” try to select the text with your cursor. If you’re unable to highlight/select it then it is not real text, and therefore not accessible for all users.
- Live text is searchable; this allows users to use search functions like CTRL + F to look for specific terms and find what they need quickly or to copy/paste text.

# Universal Design Center

Accessibility ensures everyone can perceive, understand, engage, navigate, and interact with technology regardless of device, software, or product without barriers.

Accessibility is not about disability it's actually about ability. It's about making easy for everyone.

- Easy to get
- Easy to understand
- Easy to use

Accessibility is for everyone.

# Canvas Ally Course - Scanned Comparison

# THE LEVEL OF WATER

the displacement of the water-level. During first stage (under 7-8) - the water is supposed to rise because the pebble is heavy. From the point of view of prediction the child is consistent; large pebble will make the water rise less high than collection of very heavy grains of lead. During second stage (7 to 11 years) the prediction is correct; the child knows that the submerged bodies will make the water rise in proportion to their bulk. But in spite of this correct prediction the child continues, oblivious to the constant self-contradictions which becomes involved in explaining the phenomenon by weight and not by volume the submerged body; he says, makes the water rise in proportion to its weight. Finally, during third stage (from 10-11 onwards), the correct explanation is found.

# FIRST STAGE

THE WATER RISES BECAUSE WEIGHT OF THE SUBMERGED BODY - Let us start with an observation taken from ordinary life. A little girl of 9, in her own home, who has never been questioned on the present subject, is the point of putting a large bunch of flowers into a vase full of water: She is stopped. Take care! Will it overflow? The child answers: No, because it isn't heavy. Thus to her mind it is not the volume of the body that matters but simply its weight; the bunch of flowers, not being heavy, can enter the water without exercising pressure and consequently without raising its level.

This little piece of everyday observation will be found to tally with the more general results which characterise our first stage. Children of this stage think that submerged bodies make the water rise by virtue of their weight; a small, heavy body will bring about a greater rise in the level than a large body of lesser weight.

What is the meaning of this statement? At first sight, it looks as though the child simply confused volume with weight, and designated volume by the word heavy. It might also appear as though, in the child's eyes, heavy...

# Accessibility Statement

As part of our commitment to excellence through diversity and inclusion, California State University, Northridge (CSUN) strives to ensure that campus communication and information technology is accessible to everyone. The California State University system statement on accessibility is articulated in California State University Executive Order 1111, in accordance with both federal and state laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act.

# Need help?

Need assistance or have a question not answered here? Please contact the Universal Design Center (UDC) at UDC@csun.edu or, during business hours (Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm Pacific time), at (818) 677-5898.

# What is Accessibility? What is Universal Design?

In this context, "accessibility" means that people with disabilities have access to facilities, information, and to technology. "Universal design" takes this concept one step further, to ensure that everyone can perceive, understand, engage, navigate, and interact regardless of ability or preference.

The UDC supports the campus community in their efforts to make it possible for individuals to learn, communicate, and share via information and communication technology. One way we do this is by assisting the campus community to ensure their information and communication technology is interoperable, usable, and accessible, that individual learning and processing styles and/or physical characteristics are not barriers to access.

# What does this mean to me?

Everyone has a part in creating accessible and usable information. The responsibility of creating and maintaining accessible content falls to the entire campus community.

# Universal Design Center Mission

The UDC supports the campus community in their efforts to make it possible for individuals to communicate and share information and communication technology.

# Heading Styles

Headings are styles to give a document structure by category or topic.

- Heading 1: Document title or main content heading/title (just one)
- Heading 2: Major section heading
- Heading 3: Sub-section of the Heading 2
- Heading 4: Sub-section of the Heading 3, and so on, ending with Heading 6
- Normal: Text or paragraph

Title in Word Style won't recognize when converting to a PDF. Start with Heading 1 for the document title.

How to create an accessible document using Microsoft Word, visit Word Essentials page www.csun.edu/udc/word

Without headings, a person using assistive technology like a screen reader cannot navigate by sections, subsections, or scan section titles to understand the document structure.

# Option 2: Edit Original PDF Documents

# What are PDF Title and Language?

# Title

- A PDF title is a more descriptive and meaningful version of the file name. PDF titles are often visible in the PDF window or tab. This visibility makes it easier to distinguish multiple PDFs before diving in.
- When multiple PDFs are open, well defined PDF titles allow for easier distinction between them. This distinction is particularly useful when relying on screen readers.

# Language

Screen readers can "speak" various languages—as long the content language is identified. If the screen reader does not support or cannot speak the defined language, the user might be informed of the content language, even if that content cannot be properly read.

Ensure the TAGS Tree are in the correct logical order to match the document pane. Manual rearrange tags as needed in the TAGS pane. After making these adjustments, start from the top of the tags tree and move through the tags pane sequentially using the down arrow key. A logical reading order start from left to right, top to bottom as illustrated. The Document Pane example is a two-columns layout hence the logical reading order starts with the first column then second column.

# 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)

The visual presentation of user interface components (their states including focus indication and boundaries and graphical objects has contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s)

Fail (UI components and graphical objects) Pass (UI components and graphical objects)

People who have low vision or colorblind could encounter some difficulty distinguishing text color from a background color if the contrast is insufficient contrast ratio 1.5:1.

This example has a great color contrast ratio of 8.7:1. The contrast is sufficient for those who have color deficiencies.

Download Colour Contrast Analyser onto your computer (PC/Mac) to ensure accessible contrast or use an online contrast checker from WebAIM.

WCAG Level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for regular sized text (12 or 14 pt. font) and 3:1 for large text (18 pt. font).

# Image Alternative or Alt Text

The purpose of Alt Text is to allow low vision or blind users who use text-to-speech assistive technologies (AT), such as screen readers, to understand the purpose of graphic images. Sighted users usually don’t see alt text unless they use AT. Screen readers and other AT can’t convert images into texts. So, when writing alt text, consider the following for images:

- What is its purpose?
- Is the image important enough to be there?
- If there is no description, what will the screen reader users miss?
- Be concise and eliminate unnecessary words.
- When completing the alt text, use proper punctuation such as periods to indicate the end of the alt text. Without proper punctuation, some screen readers will run the alt text into the body text that follows and cause confusion to the user.

Screen readers and other AT announce that it’s an “image” or “graphic”, then read the alt text: “Three plants going through transformation with text quote Accessibility user-friendly document for CSUN student success.”

There is no limit to the number of characters, but keep alt text descriptions short around 200 characters or less.

Don’t use images of text for headings instead use live text (fully editable or selectable text).

# How to Describe Images?

In the Tigrinya language of Eritrea and Ethiopia, Haben means "pride."

A stair chase leading up to an entryway is painted yellow with bold black text that reads museums are now.

A hand reaches out of a computer screen giving the hand gesture for stop. The screen reads ‘access denied!’

On the left is the book cover for Haben The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law, and on the right is the quote: “In the Tigrinya language of Eritrea and Ethiopia, Haben means 'pride.’”

# What is the Content Pane?

The Content Pane shows you the elements on a page and holds all the content within your PDF.

You should be familiar with structural elements of PDF documents before editing them in the Content Pane.

The Content Pane can be difficult to navigate because it is not properly organized.

Editing your Content Pane is most helpful when you have PDFs with lots of graphics or overlapping information. If content is hidden in your PDF, you can go to the Content Pane to find it and reorganize to find the missing info.

# Order Pane

• DO NOT use Order Pane to rearrange logical reading order in sequence. Screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver don’t use Order Pane to read the document instead they use TAGS to read the document.

• In theory the Order Pane and Tags Pane are supposed to match but often they don’t for more complex or untagged documents.

• If the reading order is incorrect order, go to TAGS Pane to rearrange the correct order.

If you have errors in an Acrobat Accessibility Check, you should have the option to show the error in either the Content Pane or the Tags Pane or both.

This lets you quickly see what the problem is.

In most cases, activating/clicking on the error will let you see what it is in the document, but being able to see it in either or both the Content and Tags Panes takes you right to the problem.
